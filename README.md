# CSX42: Design Patterns -  Assignment 2



Depending on the position of the driver in the race, he/she is in a different state of mind. The states of drivers are defined below.


1.	If a driver is LEADING, then the driver is in a CONFIDENT state of mind.
2.	If a driver is LOSING, then the driver is in RECKLESS state of mind.
3.	If a driver is HOLDING_ON, then the driver is in a CALCULATIVE state of mind.


Implemented State Pattern for this project to note changes in driver state.
